# Counting Triangle Project
This is a project made for counting triangles in a graph using parallellization with CUDA.
In this project, I used different approaches to count triangles in a graph.
To run the code, you need to have a machine equipped with a NVIDIA GPU, and cuda toolkit to compile the code.
## Compilation
To compile the code run the ``` make ``` command in the terminal
## Run
To run the code, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
./out  <arguments>
```
### Arguments
- -i : Input file path (in a METIS style format, look at the  [manual](https://sites.cc.gatech.edu/dimacs10/data/manual.ps) for further information)
- -d : Specify if the graph is directed, if there is no such flag, the graph is considered undirected
- -h : To display help message
- -help : To display help message
- -b : To run the code in benchmarking mode
- -v : Verbose mode
- -mode : To specify which approach to use for counting triangles. Possible values are:
    - 0: Edge Iterator
    - 1: Node Iterator
    - 2: Tensor Core Matrix Multiplication
### Example
An example of running the code is as follows:
```bash
./out -i input.graph -t -mode 1
```
In this way, the code will take the input graph from the file "input.graph", count the triangles using the Node Iterator approach, and display the time taken to count the triangles.
## TESTING
To run the tests, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
make run_test
```
This will run the test suite to verify the correctness of the triangle counting implementations.

  
## Logic Behind Different Approaches
### Edge Iterator
In this approach, we iterate over each edge in the graph and for each edge (u, v), we find the common neighbors of u and v. The number of common neighbors gives the number of triangles that include the edge (u, v). This approach is efficient for sparse graphs.
### Node Iterator
In this approach, we iterate over each node in the graph and for each node u, we find all pairs of neighbors (v, w) of u. If there is an edge between v and w, then (u, v, w) forms a triangle. This approach is more efficient for dense graphs.
### Tensor Core Matrix Multiplication
Since tensor cores are limited to a maximum of 16x16 matrix multiplication, I tried to use tile logic, diving the CSR matrix into 16x16, eventually padding the matrix to fit into 16x16 tiles.
Then, I multiplied the tiles using tensor cores, and finally summed the resulting matrix's diagonal to get the number of triangles.
